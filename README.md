# ARCFOUR Encryption with Go
## About this project
This personal project aims to delve into the ARCFOUR (also known as RC4) encryption algorithm, focusing on its implementation and usage using the Go programming language. ARCFOUR is a symmetric stream cipher that has been widely used in various applications due to its simplicity and speed.

**Objectives**
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the ARCFOUR encryption algorithm, including its history, cryptographic principles, and common use cases.
- Implement the ARCFOUR algorithm from scratch in Golang.
- Develop functionalities to encrypt and decrypt data using the implemented ARCFOUR algorithm.

**Learning Outcomes**
- Deepen knowledge of cryptographic algorithms and their practical implementations.
- Enhanced Golang programming skills through the development of a cryptographic algorithm.
- Developed an understanding of the security implications of using stream ciphers and best practices for cryptographic security.
